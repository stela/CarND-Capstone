## Training a Traffic Lights Detection and Classification Network

This task is about the perception module of the capstone project of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program.

To build up a robust and computational efficient system for traffic light detection and classification based on a deep neural network architecture, one might think about the following points:

- What framework to use for training and inference (TensorFlow can be used in the car environment)
- What neural network architecture to use
- What datasets for training can be used
- How to augment images for creating a robust network
- How to deploy the trained model to the car environment


### Framework

The [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) is a way to tackle the problem. Next to other really handy frameworks like [Darknet YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/), it is easy to use for fast prototyping, training, training monitoring and graph exports.

### Neural Network Architectures

There are several architectures for object detection that have pros and cons. To name some of them:

- Faster RCNN Architectures with different backends (slow but very accurate)
- SingleShotDetectors (SSD) with different backends (very fast but not as accurate)
- You Only Look Once (YOLO) with Darknet backends (fast and accurate)


### Pre-Trained Network

It is usefull to start with a pre-trained network and fine tune it on the specific task. Most networks are pre-trained on object-detection datasets like [COCO Dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#home) 


### Dataset

For this project, I want to use the following datasets for fine tuning:
- [Lisa Traffic Light Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mbornoe/lisa-traffic-light-dataset/home)
- [CamVid](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamVid/)
- [Bosch Small Traffic Lights Dataset](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/6132)


### Training

Before the training begins, the specific datasets have to be converted to the framework-specific format. In this case to TF Record files. Three classes (red, yellow, green) are encoded with their bounding boxes.

The actual training is done via [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) and is monitored with Tensorboard.

Both, precision values and validation images can be shown in Tensorboard.

## Iteration 1 - Testing Faster RCNN (ResNet50) on Lisa Traffic Light Dataset

Iteration 1 is done with finetuning a *Faster RCNN Network with ResNet50 Backbone (pretrained on MS COCO)*. This network is fine tuned 200k steps on the [Lisa Traffic Light Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mbornoe/lisa-traffic-light-dataset/home).

The images of the Lisa Traffic Light Dataset look like this:

## Work to do

- Training on the other datasets
- Speed up by training different architectures
- Get invariance of traffic light size
- Integrate into main project
